## Lights Out
A fun game built using ReactJS. The objective is to turn all the lights off (To grey).  
Clicking on a single tile will toggle four neighbouring tiles (Top and bottom; Left and right).  
If a tile on one of the corners is clicked, it is quite obvious that only three adjacent ones will be toggled.
