## Lights Out
A fun game built using ReactJS. The objective is to turn all the lights off (To grey).  
Clicking on a single tile will toggle itself and four neighbouring tiles (Top and bottom; Left and right).  
If a tile on one of the edges is clicked, three adjacent ones will be toggled with the tile itself. Tiles on the corner will trigger two adjacent tiles along with itself.
